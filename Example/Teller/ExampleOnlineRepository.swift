     The tag is to make each instance of OnlineRepositoryGetDataRequirements unique. The tag is used to determine how old cached data is to determine if fresh data needs to be fetched or not. If the tag matches previoiusly cached data of the same tag, the data that data was fetched will be queried and determined if it's considered too old and will fetch fresh data or not from the result of the compare.
     
     The best practice is to use the name of the OnlineRepositoryGetDataRequirements subclass and the value of any variables that are used for fetching fresh data.

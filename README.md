# Teller

iOS library that manages the state of your app's data. Teller facilitates loading cached data and fetching fresh data so your app's data is always up-to-date.

Teller works very well with MVVM and MVI design patterns (note the use of `Repository` subclasses in the library). However, you do not need to use these design patterns to use it.

[Read the official announcement of Teller](https://levibostian.com/blog/manage-cached-data-teller/) to learn more about what it does and why to use it.

*Android developer?* Check out the [Android version of Teller](https://github.com/levibostian/Teller-Android/). 

## What is Teller?

The data used in your mobile app: user profiles, a collection of photos, list of friends, etc. *all have state*. Your data is in 1 of many different states:

* Being fetched for the first time (if it comes from an async network call)
* The data is empty
* Data exists in the device's storage (cached).
* During the empty and data states, your app could also be fetching fresh data to replace the cached data on the device that is out of date.

Determining what state your data is in and managing it can be a big pain. That is where Teller comes in. All you need to do is tell Teller how to save your data, query your data, and how to fetch fresh data (probably with a network API call) and Teller facilities everything else for you. Teller will query your cached data, parse it to determine the state of it, fetch fresh data if the cached data is too old, and deliver the state of the data to listeners so you can update the UI to your users.

## Why use Teller?

When creating mobile apps that cache data (such as offline-first mobile apps), it is important to show in your app's UI the state of your cached data to the app user. Telling your app user how old data is, if your app is performing a network call, if there were any errors during network calls, if the data set is empty or not. These are all states that data can be in and notifying your user of these states helps your user trust your app and feel they are in control.

Well, keeping track of the state of your data can be complex. Querying a database is easy. Performing an network API call is easy. Updating the UI of your app is easy. But tying all of that together can be difficult. That is why Teller was created. You take care of querying data, saving data, fetching fresh data via a network call and let Teller take care of everything else.

For example: If you are building a Twitter client app that is offline-first, when the user opens your app you should be showing them a list of cached tweets so that the user has something to interact with and not a loading screen saying "Loading tweets, please wait...". When you show this list of cached tweets, you may also be performing an API network call in the background to fetch the newest tweets for your user. In the UI of your app, you should be notifying your user that your app is fetching fresh tweets or else your user may think your app is broken. Keeping your user always informed about exactly what your app is doing is a good idea to follow. Teller helps you keep track of the state of your data and facilitates keeping it up to date.

Here are the added benefits of Teller:

* Small. The only dependency at this time is RxSwift ([follow this issue as I work to remove this 1 dependency and make it optional](https://github.com/levibostian/Teller-iOS/issues/6)). Teller is made to do 1 job and do it well. 
* Built for Swift, by Swift. Teller is written in Swift which means you can expect a nice to use API.
* Not opinionated. Teller does not care where your data is stored or how it is queried. You simply tell Teller when you're done fetching, saving, and querying and Teller takes care of delivering it to the listeners.
* Well tested. Currently running in production apps. 

## Installation

Teller is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Teller). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Teller', '~> version-here'
```

Replace `version-here` with: [![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Teller.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Teller) as this is the latest version at this time. 

**Note: Teller is in early development.** Even though it is used in production in my own apps, it is still early on in development as I use the library more and more, it will mature.

I plan to release the library in an alpha, beta, then stable release phase.

#### Stages:

Alpha (where the library is at currently):

- [ ] Create example app on how to use it.
- [X] Documentation for README created.
- [ ] Make non-RxSwift version of the library to make it even smaller and more portable.
- [ ] Documentation in form of Jazzy Apple Doc created.
- [X] Fixup the API for the library if needed.

Beta:

- [ ] Library API has been used enough that the API does not have any huge changes planned for it.
- [X] Tests written (and passing ðŸ˜‰) for the library.
- [ ] API for quickly and easily creating tests with Teller in your app using Teller such as mocking the Teller API and setting up the environment. 

Stable:

- [ ] Library has been running in many production apps. Library has proven to cover most appropriate use cases and issues have been resolved to the point library is considered stable. 

# Getting started

Teller is designed with 1 goal in mind: Help you add cache support to your app quickly and easily. You help Teller understand where the cache is saved, how to get it, and Teller takes care of the rest. Let's get going. 

* First, create an implementation of `RepositoryDataSource`. 

Here is an example. 

```swift
import Foundation
import Teller
import RxSwift
import Moya

class ReposRequirements: RepositoryRequirements {
    
    /**
     The tag is used to determine how old your cache is. Teller uses this to determine if a fresh cache needs to be fetched or not. If the tag matches previously cached data of the same tag, the data that data was fetched will be queried and determined if it's considered too old and will fetch fresh data or not from the result of the compare.
     
     The best practice is to describe what the cache represents. "Repos for <username>" is a great example. 
     */
    var tag: ReposRepositoryRequirements.Tag {
        return "Repos for \(username)"
    }
    
    let username: String
    
    init(username: String) {
        self.username = username
    }
}

// Struct used to represent the JSON data pulled from the GitHub API.
struct Repo: Codable {
    var id: Int!
    var name: String!
}

class ReposRepositoryDataSource: RepositoryDataSource {
    
    typealias Cache = [Repo]
    typealias Requirements = ReposRepositoryRequirements
    typealias FetchResult = [Repo]
    
    var maxAgeOfCache: Period = Period(unit: 5, component: .hour)
    
    func fetchFreshCache(requirements: ReposRepositoryRequirements) -> Single<FetchResponse<[Repo]>> {
        // Return network call that returns a RxSwift Single.
        // The project Moya (https://github.com/moya/moya) is my favorite library to do this.
                
        return MoyaProvider<GitHubService>().rx.request(.listRepos(user: requirements.username))
            .map({ (response) -> FetchResponse<[Repo]> in
                let repos = try! JSONDecoder().decode([Repo].self, from: response.data)
                
                // If there was a failure, use FetchResponse.failure(Error) and the error will be sent to your user in the UI
                return FetchResponse.success(data: repos)
            })
    }
    
    // Note: Teller runs this function from a background thread.
    func saveCache(_ fetchedData: [Repo], requirements: ReposRepositoryRequirements) throws {
        // Save data to CoreData, Realm, UserDefaults, File, whatever you wish here.
        // If there is an error, you may throw it, and have it get passed to the observer of the Repository.
    }
    
    // Note: Teller runs this function from the UI thread
    func observeCache(requirements: ReposRepositoryRequirements) -> Observable<[Repo]> {
        // Return Observable that is observing the cached data.
        //
        // When any of the repos in the database have been changed, we want to trigger an Observable update.
        // Teller may call `observeCachedData` regularly to keep data fresh.
        
        return Observable.just([])
    }

    // Note: Teller runs this function from the same thread as `observeCachedData()`
    func isCacheEmpty(_ cache: [Repo], requirements: ReposRepositoryRequirements) -> Bool {
        return cache.isEmpty
    }
    
}
```

* The last step. Observe your cache. Do this with a `Repository` instance.

```swift 
let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
let repository: Repository = Repository(dataSource: ReposRepositoryDataSource())

repository.requirements = ReposRepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "username to get repos for")
repository
    .observe()
    .observeOn(ConcurrentDispatchQueueScheduler(qos: .background))
    .subscribeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
    .subscribe(onNext: { (dataState: DataState<[Repo]>) in
        switch dataState.cacheState() {
        case .cacheEmpty?:
            // Cache is empty. Repos for this specific user has been fetched before, but they do not have any for their account.
            break
        case .cacheData(let repos, let dateReposWhereFetched)?:
            // Here are the repos for the user!
            // You can figure out how old the cached data is with `dateReposWhereFetched` as it's a Date.
            break
        case .none:
            // the dataState has no cached state yet. This probably means that repos have never been fetched for this specific username before.
            // Use the `noCacheState` to get more details on the state on not having a cache.
            break
        }
        switch dataState.noCacheState() {
        case .noCache?:
            // Repos have never been fetched before for the specific user. Cache data is not beging fetched at this time.
            break
        case .firstFetchOfData?:
            // Repos have never been fetched before for the specific user. So, this state means that repos are being fetched for the very first time for this user.
            break
        case .finishedFirstFetchOfData(let errorDuringFetch)?:
            // Repos have been fetched for the very first time for this specific user. A `cacheState()` will also be sent to the dataState. This state does *not* mean that the fetch was successful. It simply means that it is done.
            
            // If there was an error that happened during the fetch, errorDuringFetch will be populated.
            
            // Note: If there is an error on first fetch, you can call `observe()` again or `refresh()` on your `Repository` to try again. It is your responsibility to manually try the first fetch again.
            break
        case .none:
            // The dataState has no first fetch state. This means that repos have been fetched before for this specific user so no first fetch is required.
            break
        }
        switch dataState.fetchingFreshDataState() {
        case .fetchingFreshCacheData?:
            // The cached repos for the specific user is too old and new, fresh data is being fetched right now.
            break
        case .finishedFetchingFreshCacheData(let errorDuringFetch)?:
            // Fresh repos have been fetched for this specific user. This state does *not* mean that the fetch was successful. It simply means that it is done.
            
            // If there was an error that happened during the fetch, errorDuringFetch will be populated.
            break
        case .none:
            // The dataState has no fetch state. This means that the repos cache is not too old or repos have never been fetched before.
            break
        }
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

Done! You are using Teller!

In order for Teller to do it's magic, you need to (1) initialize the `requirements` property and (2) `observe()` the `Repository` instance. This gives Teller the information it needs to begin. 

Enjoy!

## Keep app data up-to-date

When users open up your app, they want to see fresh data. Not data that is out dated. To do this, it's best to perform background refreshes while your app is in the background. 

Teller provides a simple method to refresh your `Repository`'s cache while in the background. Run this function as often as you wish. Teller will only perform a new fetch for fresh cache is the cache is outdated. 

```swift
let repository: Repository = Repository(dataSource: ReposRepositoryDataSource())
repository.requirements = ReposRepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "username to get repos for")

repository.refresh(force: false)
        .subscribe()
```

*Note: You can use the [Background app refresh](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/managing_your_app_s_life_cycle/preparing_your_app_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh) feature in iOS to run `refresh` on a set of `Repository`s periodically.*

## Manual refresh of cache

Do you have a `UITableView` with pull-to-refresh enabled? Do you have a refresh button in your `UINavigationBar` that you want your users to refresh the data when it's pressed? 

No problem. Tell your Teller `Repository` instance to force refresh:

```swift
let repository: Repository = Repository(dataSource: ReposRepositoryDataSource())
repository.requirements = ReposRepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "username to get repos for")

repository.refresh(force: true)
        .subscribe()
```

# Testing 

Teller was built with unit/integration/UI testing in mind. Here is how to use Teller in your tests:

## Write unit tests against `RepositoryDataSource` implementations

Your implementations of `RepositoryDataSource` should be no problem. `RepositoryDataSource` is just a protocol. You can unit test your implementation using dependency injection, for example, to test all of the functions of `RepositoryDataSource`. 

## Write unit tests for code that depends on `Repository`

For your app's code that uses the Teller `Repository` class, use the pre-built `Repository` mock for your unit tests. Inject the mock into your class under test using dependency injection. 

Here is an example XCTest for unit testing a class that depends on Teller's `Repository`. 

```swift
import RxBlocking
import RxSwift
@testable import YourApp
import XCTest

class RepositoryViewModelTest: XCTestCase {
    var viewModel: ReposViewModel!
    var repository: RepositoryMock<ReposRepositoryDataSource>!

    override func setUp() {
        // Create an instance of `RepositoryMock`
        repository = RepositoryMock(dataSource: ReposRepositoryDataSource())
        // Provide the repository mock to your code under test with dependency injection
        viewModel = ReposViewModel(reposRepository: repository)
    }
    
    func test_observeRepos_givenReposRepositoryObserve_expectReceiveCacheFromReposRepository() {
        // 1. Setup the mock
        let given: DataState<[Repo]> = DataState.testing.cache(requirements: ReposRepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "username"), lastTimeFetched: Date()) {
            $0.cache([
                Repo(id: 1, name: "repo-name")
            ])
        }
        repository.observeClosure = {
            return Observable.just(given)
        }
        
        // 2. Run the code under test
        let actual = try! repository.observe().toBlocking().first()
        
        // 3. Assert your code under test is working
        XCTAssertEqual(given, actual)
    }
    
    func test_setReposToObserve_givenUsername_expectSetRepositoryRequirements() {
        let given = "random-username"
        
        // Run your code under test
        viewModel.setReposToObserve(username: given)

        // Pull out the properties of the repository mock to see if your code under test works as expected
        XCTAssertTrue(repository.requirementsCalled)
        XCTAssertEqual(repository.requirementsCallsCount, 1)
        let actual = repository.requirementsInvocations[0]!.username
        XCTAssertEqual(given, actual)
    }

}
```

## Write integration tests around Teller 

Integration tests are a great way to make sure that many moving pieces of your code are working together correctly. Teller provides easy ways for you to write integration tests in your app that uses Teller. 

The idea behind testing with Teller is to give Teller a pre-defined state to be in. Maybe you need to write an integration test for when the app starts up for the first time. Maybe you need to write a test where a cache already exists that Teller fetched. Let's get into how we do this in our tests. 

1. Always clear Teller in the `setup()` test function:

```swift
import XCTest
import Teller 

class YourIntegrationTests: XCTestCase {    

    override func setUp() {        
        Teller.shared.clear()
    }
}
```

2. In your test function, give Teller an initial state:

```swift
import XCTest
import Teller 

class YourIntegrationTests: XCTestCase {    
    private var dataSource: RepositoryDataSource<String, RepositoryRequirements, String>!
    private var repository: Repository<RepositoryDataSource<String, RepositoryRequirements, String>>!

    override func setUp() {
        dataSource = RepositoryDataSource()
        repository = Repository(dataSource: dataSource)
        
        Teller.shared.clear()
    }

    func test_tellerNoCach() {                
        let requirements = RepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "")
        
        _ = Repository.testing.initState(repository: repository, requirements: requirements) {
            $0.noCache()
        }     

        // Teller is all setup! When your app's code uses the `repository`, it will behave just like the `Repository` has never fetched a cache successfully before. 

        // Write the remainder of your integration test function here. 
    }

    func test_tellerCacheEmpty() {                
        let requirements = RepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "")
        
        _ = Repository.testing.initState(repository: repository, requirements: requirements) {
            $0.cacheEmpty() {
                $0.cacheTooOld()
            }            
        }     

        // Teller is all setup! When your app's code uses the `repository`, it will behave just like the `Repository` has fetched a cache successfully, the cache is empty, and the cache is too old which means Teller will attempt to fetch a fresh cache the next time the `Repository` runs.

        // There are other options for `$0.cacheEmpty()` such as:
        //  $0.cacheEmpty() {
        //    $0.cacheNotTooOld()
        //  }         
        // 
        // $0.cacheEmpty() {
        //    $0.lastFetched(Date.yesterday)
        //  }

        // Write the remainder of your integration test function here. 
    }    

    func test_tellerCacheNotEmpty() {
        let requirements = RepositoryDataSource.Requirements(username: "")
        let existingCache = "existing-cache"
        
        _ = Repository.testing.initState(repository: repository, requirements: requirements) {
            $0.cache(existingCache) {
                $0.cacheNotTooOld()
            }
        }     
        // *Note: If your `DataSource.saveCache()` function needs to be executed on a background thread, use `Repository.testing.initStateAsync()` instead of `initState()` shown here. `initSync()` runs the `DataSource.saveCache()` on the thread that you call `initState()` on.*

        // Teller is all setup! When your app's code uses the `repository`, it will behave just like the `Repository` has fetched a cache successfully, the cache is not empty and contains "existing-cache", and the cache is not too old (the default behavior when a state is not given) which means Teller will not attempt to fetch a fresh cache the next time the `Repository` runs.

        // There are other options for `$0.cache(existingCache)`. They are the same options as $0.cacheEmpty() described above.

        // Write the remainder of your integration test function here. 
    }
}
```

## Example app

This library does *not* yet have a fully functional example iOS app created (yet). However, if you check out the directory: `Example/Teller/` you will see example code snippets that you can use to learn about how to use Teller, learn best practices, and compile inside of XCode. 

## Documentation

Documentation is coming shortly. This README is all of the documentation created thus far.

If you read the README and still have questions, please, [create an issue](https://github.com/levibostian/teller-ios/issues/new) with your question. I will respond with an answer and update the README docs to help others in the future. 

## Are you building an offline-first mobile app?

Teller is designed for developers building offline-first mobile apps. If you are someone looking to build an offline-first mobile app, also be sure to checkout [Wendy-iOS](https://github.com/levibostian/wendy-ios) (there is an [Android version too](https://github.com/levibostian/wendy-android)). Wendy is designed to sync your device's cached data with remote storage. Think of it like this: Teller is really good at `GET` calls for your network API, Wendy is really good at `PUT, POST, DELETE` network API calls. Teller *pulls* data, Wendy *pushes* data. These 2 libraries work really nicely together! 

## Development 

Teller is a pretty simple CocoaPods XCode workspace. Follow the directions below for the optimal development experience. 

* Install cocoapods/gems and setup workspace:

```bash
$> bundle install
$> cd Example/; pod install; cd ..; 
$> ./hooks/autohook.sh install # installs git hooks 
```

# Where did the name come from?

This library is a powerful Repository. The Repository design pattern is commonly found in the MVVM and MVI patterns. A synonym of repository is *bank*. A *bank teller* is someone who manages your money at a bank and triggers transactions. So, since this library facilitates transactions, teller fits.
